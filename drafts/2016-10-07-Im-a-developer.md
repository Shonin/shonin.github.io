### Well this is awkward

I always thought that being a developer would be too hard. I knew I was smart,
but what the hell does `for index, item in enumerate(items)` mean. I really wanted
to learn, and I'm not one for starting at the beginning, so I looked
up `for`, then I looked up `index`, `item`, etc. Determined to brute-force my
way into being an engineer.

I used to think when I was about 10 that I could fake my way to being a
piano player by memorizing every key in a really hard song. The timing and
everything. And why not? A robot could play any song by doing exactly that,
with no knowledge required.

So why was my friend in high school practicing piano every day for five hours?
What did he know that I didn't know?
